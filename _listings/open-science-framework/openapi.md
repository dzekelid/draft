    get:
      summary: List all draft registrations
      description: |-
        A paginated list of all of the draft registrations of a given node.

        Draft registrations contain the supplemental registration questions that accompany a registration. A registration is a frozen version of the project that can never be edited or deleted, but can be withdrawn.

        Your original project remains editable but will now have the draft registration linked to it.
        #### Permissions
        Only project administrators may view draft registrations.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of 10 draft registrations. Each resource in the array is a separate draft registration object and contains the full representation of the draft registration, meaning additional requests to a draft registration's detail view are not necessary.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#Introduction_pagination).

    patch:
      summary: Update a draft registration
      description: |-
        Updates a draft registration by setting the values of the attributes specified in the request body. Any unspecified attributes will be left unchanged.

        Draft registrations contain the supplemental registration questions that accompany a registration. Answer the questions in the draft registration supplement by sending update requests until you are ready to submit the draft.

        The registration supplement of a draft registration cannot be updated after the draft has been created.

        When updating a draft registration, `registration_metadata` is required. It must be a dictionary with keys as question ids in the registration form, and values as nested dictionaries matching the specific format in the [registration schema](TODO: link me pls).

        If a question is multiple-choice, the question response must exactly match one of the possible choices.
        #### Permissions
        Only project administrators may update draft registrations.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the new representation of the updated draft registration, if the request is successful.

        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#Introduction_error_codes) to understand why this request may have failed.
